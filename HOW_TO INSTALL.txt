FIRST YOU NEED TO INSTALL THIS COMPENENT OR NOTHING WILL WORK
yum -y install bind-utils;
after that place your spf folder in your html directory and give the folder that permission by this cmd
chmod 777 -R YOUR DIRECTORY
then configure the path to .htpwd in htaccess 
the default login and password is admin:12345
THAT ALL :)
